# EulerProjectAnswers
This poblic repository will only include (my personal) answers for the first 100 problems, as per the rules of the euler project. Once I have reached problem 100, I will either creater another private repository or make this one private.

Please do yourself a favour and try to solve them, before checking the solutions of someone else.

The solutions contained in this repository are in no way optimal. I sometimes experiment with concepts to learn them while doing a fun problem, instead of choosing a "better" path. This is even true for all of my answers, which are written in c++,
which isn't my preferred language at the time of writing this readme.
